10.42.0.119,-,2025-10-11 12:07:55,"The Iris dataset, often called the simplest of all datasets, is here to give you a bit of nostalgia—about the time you first started learning AI and data science, that first thrill of building a model, and the happiness when you saw a good accuracy score.

You must have heard about the Iris dataset before, but let’s repeat just for the sake of it.
The dataset contains measurements of three species of the iris flower. It has four numerical features—petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width—that help you classify the flowers into their respective species.

Here, you will get the same dataset but with a twist. You have to classify the same three flower classes, but both your training and testing data have been distorted by the clever jester. The jester has given you a hint: 'all the features have been treated with a structured noise. The new distorted values are simply the original values after being passed through a specific mathematical function. If you find the noise function and denoise the distorted values, solving this version of the Iris dataset becomes straightforward.'"

If you’ve worked with the Iris dataset before, you know it’s usually a walk in the park because the species can often be separated just by looking at plots. But this time, things might look a little different.

You can use anything and everything at your disposal, including the original Iris dataset from sklearn. You can import the original dataset without distorted values for comparison."
