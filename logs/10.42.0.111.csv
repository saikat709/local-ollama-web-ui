10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 09:43:59,Is LabelEncoder better for preprocessing of natural language in scikit-learn or something else?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 09:46:38,Great. Is RandomForestRegression better or LogisticRegression for NLP?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:04:02,The provided test.csv file for problem 1 of this competition doesn't contain IDs. But the submission format indicates that ID is needed. What should I do?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:08:03,Give a simple code snippet to create a dataframe from the predicted values in order to save submission.csv
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:12:10,"Give a simple code snippet to use TfidVectorizer to convert strings into numerical values of this code: 
X_train = train_df[features]
y_train = train_df[""Genre""] # ""Genre"" is our target."
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:14:41,"If I train a model on vectorized values, it may also output y_pred as vectorized values, right? So if that's true, give me a simple code snippet that converts it to a string again."
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:23:00,"Why is this error: TypeError: A sparse matrix was passed, but dense data is required. Use X.toarray() to convert to a dense numpy array."
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:24:05,"But using that makes me stumble upon: ValueError: y should be a 1d array, got an array of shape (125, 29) instead"
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:25:49,"I am using LogisticRegression with model.fit() Y is the vectorized thing. I did what you said but this time this error: ""ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [1, 3625]"""
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:31:18,"What is the cause of this error when y_train is vectorized .flatten(): ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [1, 3625]"
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:32:22,"No, I get this error after I've flatten it and using it in model.fit()"
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:43:37,"Explain this line: model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, solver='saga', multi_class='multinomial', random_state=42, class_weight=""balanced"")"
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:44:45,Can you change it to a simpler configuration for a drama genre predictor while keeping it efficient?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:47:07,Explain solver=saga and multi_class=multinomial for a logisticregression model.
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:50:55,"I have an array named ""y_pred"". Now I want to convert it to a dataframe with the following columns: Id - an id number that starts from 1, Genre - the column to put y_pred values in. Please use pandas to make a such dataframe."
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 10:56:09,How to remove the first value of an array and convert it to a string in python?

10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 11:02:23,How to remove the first item from an array in normal python?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 11:35:56,Is RandomForestRegression better or LogisticRegression for the iris data set provided in the sk-learn module?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 11:43:48,"When I use logisticregressor, and inverse the prediction with label encoder to string, it works. But when I keep the code untouched and just change logisticregressor to randomforestregressor, it says y contains previously unseen labels. Why?"
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 11:52:10,"In the default iris dataset provided by sklearn, is it already encoded or is it the direct numbers?"
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 12:16:43,"I made a RandomForestClassifier model for the classic Iris dataset available in scikit-learn. But my code doesn't predict the third classification. The code is supposed to predict either 0, 1 or 2. But it only predicts 0 and 1."
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 12:23:47,Give me simple code for training a classifier model based on the iris dataset provided by scikit-learn and loading a test.csv to test it. Keep it simple yet efficient because I am only wanting to see a efficient demo.
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 12:25:53,Can you please make the code simpler so it loads only test.csv?
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 12:47:06,Imagine I am trying to build a model that classifies a image 'north' or 'south' based on the direction of an arrow. Now give me basic demo code for this.
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 12:48:12,Please use tensorflow with ResNetV2
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 12:51:53,Please write a very simple demo code that uses tensorflow with resnetv2 to build a image classification model. The model would be based on resnetv2 and would be able to identify if an arrow is 'north' or 'south' or if no arrow exists.
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 13:07:01,Please write a simple code for reading train.csv then transfer-training a resnet50v2 model on it to detect the labels for images. Make it a demo of kaggle solution also generating submission.csv from test.csv.
10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 13:16:05,ImportError: cannot import name 'ResNet50V2' from 'tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50'

10.42.0.111,-,2025-10-11 13:54:01,Please provide loading an h5 file for tensorflow. The rules say you can use a pretrained models if the question allows to.
