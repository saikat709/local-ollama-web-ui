Note: This code assumes that all genres are equally weighted when determining the common one. If you want to weight genres based on their frequency or importance, modify the get_common_and_unique function accordingly.

Note: To directly submit to Kaggle, you need to make a few changes:

    You should use the sklearn library for submission. You can do this by importing it and using its methods (make_scorer, GridSearchCV) or creating your own function.
    Modify your code to output predictions in the correct format (i.e., one value per row, with a header column named 'target').
    Use Kaggle's make_submission command to create a submission file.

Here is an example of how you could modify your code:

import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/test-and-train/train(1).csv')

X = data.drop(['target'], axis=1)
y_pred = model.predict(X)

submission_df = pd.DataFrame(y_pred, columns=['target'])

submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)

This will create a submission file named submission.csv in the current working directory. Make sure to replace 'submission.csv' with your desired filename.

Please make sure that you have followed all the Kaggle guidelines and rules before submitting your solution.
