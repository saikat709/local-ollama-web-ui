An evil and playful jester has turned up to become an antagonist in the field of AI. Historians are assuming he is the reincarnation of an evil data scientist. He has taken the classic Iris dataset and applied a single mathematical transformation to all the features. Both the training and testing data are now ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù in a clever way.

The jester loves to tangle the minds of data scientists, leaving subtle clues in the data. Your challenge is to explore, visualize, and detect the transformation he used. Can you figure out his trick and reveal the original patterns in the data? Or will you be another victim of the joker's trickery ?
N.B :

    Before the competition ends, please make sure to share your code file with the host of the competition. It should be the code of your best performing model. If you fail to do this, your submission shall be disregarded.
    The jester has also provided a baseline code for you so that you have better chances of winning against him. You can view the baseline code in the Discussion tab.

Description

The Iris dataset, often called the simplest of all datasets, is here to give you a bit of nostalgia‚Äîabout the time you first started learning AI and data science, that first thrill of building a model, and the happiness when you saw a good accuracy score.

You must have heard about the Iris dataset before, but let‚Äôs repeat just for the sake of it.
The dataset contains measurements of three species of the iris flower. It has four numerical features‚Äîpetal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width‚Äîthat help you classify the flowers into their respective species.

Here, you will get the same dataset but with a twist. You have to classify the same three flower classes, but both your training and testing data have been distorted by the clever jester. The jester has given you a hint: 'all the features have been treated with a structured noise. The new distorted values are simply the original values after being passed through a specific mathematical function. If you find the noise function and denoise the distorted values, solving this version of the Iris dataset becomes straightforward.'

If you‚Äôve worked with the Iris dataset before, you know it‚Äôs usually a walk in the park because the species can often be separated just by looking at plots. But this time, things might look a little different.

You can use anything and everything at your disposal, including the original Iris dataset from sklearn. You can import the original dataset without distorted values for comparison.

# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

Note left by the jester:
All features have been transformed using the same noise function. Both the train and test datasets use this function. The function is a single mathematical operation. This task tests whether you can remove noise based on probabilistic or deterministic methods.

A small piece of advice:
The jester loves to tangle your thoughts. Try to visualize what you know. Simple mathematical reasoning and knowledge about graphs may crack the code. Overthinking is a sin.

You‚Äôre going to have a great time with this problem‚Ä¶ or will you? üå∏
Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the macro-averaged F1-score.

For each class i, the F1-score is defined as:

where

and ( TP_i ), ( FP_i ), and ( FN_i ) represent the true positives, false positives, and false negatives for class i.

The macro F1-score is then computed as the simple average across all classes:

Each row in the test set corresponds to one flower sample.
Your goal is to predict the correct species label (target) for each ID.

Public leaderboard scores are calculated on 30% of the test data ,
and private leaderboard scores are calculated on the remaining 70%
Submission Format

To submit, upload a CSV file with exactly these two columns:
ID 	target
51 	0
52 	1
53 	2
‚Ä¶ 	‚Ä¶
Requirements:

    The ID values must exactly match those provided in the test set.
    The target column should contain your predicted class labels (0, 1, or 2).
    Do not include any extra columns or headers besides ID and target.

Example Submission

ID,target
51,1
52,0
53,2

Your final score on the leaderboard will be computed as the macro F1-score between your predictions and the hidden ground-truth labels using:

from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')"
