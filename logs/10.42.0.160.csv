Her mentor, Professor Haruto, is a legendary figure in their university — eccentric, brilliant, and deeply passionate about cinema. He’s the kind of professor who quotes classic Korean dramas in class and believes that “data tells the real story behind every masterpiece.”

For months, Haruto had been preparing his magnum opus — a massive research presentation for the FilmFare Local Showcase, the university’s grandest annual event where film scholars, critics, and students come together to celebrate the art of storytelling.
This showcase wasn’t just another presentation — it was his reputation, legacy, and pride on the line.

    But disaster struck the night before the showcase

As the clock hit midnight, Haruto inserted his old pen drive into his laptop… only to be greeted by a single line of horror:

    “Drive not readable. Files corrupted”

Years of his research — gone.
The carefully labeled K-Drama dataset, a record of thousands of dramas and their genres, had lost half its entries.
Only 50% of the genre data remained intact. The other half? Completely blank.

Panic set in. The presentation was due in just a few hours, and without the genre analysis, his entire talk would collapse.

In a moment of desperation, Haruto called his most promising student — Aera.
She had always been fascinated by how genres shape emotions, and she had built small models for fun before.
Now, this wasn’t a classroom assignment anymore — it was a real challenge.

Haruto’s voice trembled as he said:

    “Aera… my dataset—it’s gone. Half of it is missing. I can’t show anything tomorrow. You’re my only hope”

The Mission

Aera now has only 5 hours to recover the missing genre labels from the corrupted dataset before sunrise.

The dataset, thankfully, still has:

    Some K-Dramas with known genres
    And the rest — dramas with missing genres that need to be predicted

The university auditorium will be full by morning. Professors, critics, and fellow students will be watching.
If Aera fails, Haruto’s years of research — and perhaps his reputation — will crumble.

But if she succeeds…
She’ll not only save her professor but also prove that even broken data can tell beautiful stories again.

Your task?
Step into Aera’s shoes.
Help her predict the missing genres of the dramas using the remaining data — accurately, efficiently, and creatively.
You have limited time and limited data — can you bring back the lost stories before dawn?

Constraint:
Due to a sudden router DNS failure at Aera’s dorm, she can’t access any external model repositories or pretrained libraries. That means no pre-built embeddings, no sentence transformers, and no pretrained neural networks.
She must design everything from scratch — craft her own model depending on other basic libraries for NLP to recover the lost genres before sunrise.

    “True creativity begins where convenience ends”

Objective:
Predict the lost Genre values in the K-Drama dataset.
Your model’s accuracy will determine whether Aera becomes the university’s hero — or the student who couldn’t save her professor’s final act.

Description

You will be given a dataset of K-Dramas with details such as titles, cast, directors, summaries, and other metadata.
Your task is to predict the genre(s) of each drama in the test set based on the available information.

Remember you can’t use any pretrained models or Hugging Face libraries here as there are some problems in Aera's local network that blocks HF. Now, no time to solve the router issue, Aera decides to get into raw codinf.

You must build your own NLP solution from scratch just like Aera, working through the night to save the day!

Good luck!
May your models be as dramatic in methodology and accuracy themselves. 💫
Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using a multi-label genre matching metric based on the Jaccard Index (Intersection over Union).

For each K-Drama in the test set:

    If all genres are predicted correctly, the score is 100%.
    Partial matches are proportionally rewarded based on overlap.
    The final score is the average over all rows and is expressed as a percentage (0–100).

The leaderboard is split 50/50 into Public and Private sets:

    Public leaderboard is visible during the competition.
    Private leaderboard determines the final ranking.

Submission File

For each ID in the test set, you must predict the genres as a comma-separated list.
Your submission file must include a header and have the following format:
Id 	Genre
1 	Drama, Romance
2 	Action, Crime, Comedy
3 	Life, Drama

Meet Aera, a devoted Film and Drama Studies student with a heart full of stories and a dream of becoming a director who changes how the world sees emotions on screen.

Her mentor, Professor Haruto, is a legendary figure in their university — eccentric, brilliant, and deeply passionate about cinema. He’s the kind of professor who quotes classic Korean dramas in class and believes that “data tells the real story behind every masterpiece.”

For months, Haruto had been preparing his magnum opus — a massive research presentation for the FilmFare Local Showcase, the university’s grandest annual event where film scholars, critics, and students come together to celebrate the art of storytelling.
This showcase wasn’t just another presentation — it was his reputation, legacy, and pride on the line.

    But disaster struck the night before the showcase

As the clock hit midnight, Haruto inserted his old pen drive into his laptop… only to be greeted by a single line of horror:

    “Drive not readable. Files corrupted”

Years of his research — gone.
The carefully labeled K-Drama dataset, a record of thousands of dramas and their genres, had lost half its entries.
Only 50% of the genre data remained intact. The other half? Completely blank.

Panic set in. The presentation was due in just a few hours, and without the genre analysis, his entire talk would collapse.

In a moment of desperation, Haruto called his most promising student — Aera.
She had always been fascinated by how genres shape emotions, and she had built small models for fun before.
Now, this wasn’t a classroom assignment anymore — it was a real challenge.

Haruto’s voice trembled as he said:

    “Aera… my dataset—it’s gone. Half of it is missing. I can’t show anything tomorrow. You’re my only hope”

The Mission

Aera now has only 5 hours to recover the missing genre labels from the corrupted dataset before sunrise.

The dataset, thankfully, still has:

    Some K-Dramas with known genres
    And the rest — dramas with missing genres that need to be predicted

The university auditorium will be full by morning. Professors, critics, and fellow students will be watching.
If Aera fails, Haruto’s years of research — and perhaps his reputation — will crumble.

But if she succeeds…
She’ll not only save her professor but also prove that even broken data can tell beautiful stories again.

Your task?
Step into Aera’s shoes.
Help her predict the missing genres of the dramas using the remaining data — accurately, efficiently, and creatively.
You have limited time and limited data — can you bring back the lost stories before dawn?

Constraint:
Due to a sudden router DNS failure at Aera’s dorm, she can’t access any external model repositories or pretrained libraries. That means no pre-built embeddings, no sentence transformers, and no pretrained neural networks.
She must design everything from scratch — craft her own model depending on other basic libraries for NLP to recover the lost genres before sunrise.

    “True creativity begins where convenience ends”

Objective:
Predict the lost Genre values in the K-Drama dataset.
Your model’s accuracy will determine whether Aera becomes the university’s hero — or the student who couldn’t save her professor’s final act.

Description

You will be given a dataset of K-Dramas with details such as titles, cast, directors, summaries, and other metadata.
Your task is to predict the genre(s) of each drama in the test set based on the available information.

Remember you can’t use any pretrained models or Hugging Face libraries here as there are some problems in Aera's local network that blocks HF. Now, no time to solve the router issue, Aera decides to get into raw codinf.

You must build your own NLP solution from scratch just like Aera, working through the night to save the day!

Good luck!
May your models be as dramatic in methodology and accuracy themselves. 💫
Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using a multi-label genre matching metric based on the Jaccard Index (Intersection over Union).

For each K-Drama in the test set:

    If all genres are predicted correctly, the score is 100%.
    Partial matches are proportionally rewarded based on overlap.
    The final score is the average over all rows and is expressed as a percentage (0–100).

The leaderboard is split 50/50 into Public and Private sets:

    Public leaderboard is visible during the competition.
    Private leaderboard determines the final ranking.

Submission File

For each ID in the test set, you must predict the genres as a comma-separated list.
Your submission file must include a header and have the following format:
Id 	Genre
1 	Drama, Romance
2 	Action, Crime, Comedy
3 	Life, Drama

Sample submission file has achieved 13% (rounded) in the current setting"
