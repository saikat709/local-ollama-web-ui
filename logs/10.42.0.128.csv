I have 20 reference images, 8 in orage and 8 in neon green. They signify directions, such as north, north-west, etc.

My limitations,

    Your solution cannot use extra images to train model. You are limited to 20 reference image.
    No manual data labeling and incorporation is allowed.

Also any pretrained models are allowed.


Here is the dataset description. 
The dataset in CSV format. The dataset contains two columns: ""image_name"" and ""label"". The ""image_name"" column refers to the image name captured from the road. The ""label"" column consists of the following categories.:
north, south, west, east, north-east, north-west, south-west, south-east

An additional category 'road' is required for the challenge but is not present in training dataset

Files
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

Columns

image_name: Image name
label: Directional Categories mentioned above

Submission Columns

Id: test image name without the extension 
label: model output

This dataset is totally based on synthetic data generated by OpenAI GPT-4o with slight editing and augmentations.

All features have been transformed using the same noise function. Both the train and test datasets use this function. The function is a single mathematical operation. This task tests whether you can remove noise based on probabilistic or deterministic methods. A small piece of advice:
The jester loves to tangle your thoughts. Try to visualize what you know. Simple mathematical reasoning and knowledge about graphs may crack the code. Overthinking is a sin.

Submission File

For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

Id, label
1,south
2,north-west
3,road
