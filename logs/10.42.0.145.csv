Her mentor, Professor Haruto, is a legendary figure in their university — eccentric, brilliant, and deeply passionate about cinema. He’s the kind of professor who quotes classic Korean dramas in class and believes that “data tells the real story behind every masterpiece.”

For months, Haruto had been preparing his magnum opus — a massive research presentation for the FilmFare Local Showcase, the university’s grandest annual event where film scholars, critics, and students come together to celebrate the art of storytelling.
This showcase wasn’t just another presentation — it was his reputation, legacy, and pride on the line.

10.42.0.145,-,2025-10-11 10:04:41,"This challenge is based on the classic Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning history.
But this time, a clever jester has stepped in and distorted the data using a structured mathematical noise.
Your mission is to denoise the data and recover the true relationships between features and flower species.
Files

    train.csv — Contains 50 samples, corresponding to the first 50 datapoints (by index) of the original Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_iris().
        These samples belong to only one class of Iris flowers.
        Use this data to investigate and compare with the original Iris dataset in order to identify the mathematical noise function.
        Do not use this data for model training — it represents only one class and will not help in prediction.

    test.csv — Contains the public test set, consisting of the remaining samples after the first 50.
        Includes only the noisy features and an ID column.
        You will use your inferred denoising function and trained model to predict the corresponding target values for this file.

    sample_submission.csv — Shows the required format for your final submission.
        Each row should contain the ID and your predicted target class (0, 1, or 2).

Important Notes

    The train data is only meant for exploratory analysis, not for building a predictive model.
    The same noise function has been applied to all features in both train and test data.
    Visualization and basic math intuition are key — the jester’s tricks are simple but deceptive.
    Use the original Iris dataset from scikit-learn to guide your reasoning:
