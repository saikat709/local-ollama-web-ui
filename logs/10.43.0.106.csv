This challenge is based on the classic Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning history.
But this time, a clever jester has stepped in and distorted the data using a structured mathematical noise.
Your mission is to denoise the data and recover the true relationships between features and flower species.
Files

    train.csv â€” Contains 50 samples, corresponding to the first 50 datapoints (by index) of the original Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_iris().
        These samples belong to only one class of Iris flowers.
        Use this data to investigate and compare with the original Iris dataset in order to identify the mathematical noise function.
        Do not use this data for model training â€” it represents only one class and will not help in prediction.

    test.csv â€” Contains the public test set, consisting of the remaining samples after the first 50.
        Includes only the noisy features and an ID column.
        You will use your inferred denoising function and trained model to predict the corresponding target values for this file.

The Iris dataset, often called the simplest of all datasets, is here to give you a bit of nostalgiaâ€”about the time you first started learning AI and data science, that first thrill of building a model, and the happiness when you saw a good accuracy score.

You must have heard about the Iris dataset before, but letâ€™s repeat just for the sake of it.
The dataset contains measurements of three species of the iris flower. It has four numerical featuresâ€”petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal widthâ€”that help you classify the flowers into their respective species.

Here, you will get the same dataset but with a twist. You have to classify the same three flower classes, but both your training and testing data have been distorted by the clever jester. The jester has given you a hint: 'all the features have been treated with a structured noise. The new distorted values are simply the original values after being passed through a specific mathematical function. If you find the noise function and denoise the distorted values, solving this version of the Iris dataset becomes straightforward.'

If youâ€™ve worked with the Iris dataset before, you know itâ€™s usually a walk in the park because the species can often be separated just by looking at plots. But this time, things might look a little different.

You can use anything and everything at your disposal, including the original Iris dataset from sklearn. You can import the original dataset without distorted values for comparison.
Import libraries

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
Load the Iris dataset

iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

Note left by the jester:
All features have been transformed using the same noise function. Both the train and test datasets use this function. The function is a single mathematical operation. This task tests whether you can remove noise based on probabilistic or deterministic methods.

A small piece of advice:
The jester loves to tangle your thoughts. Try to visualize what you know. Simple mathematical reasoning and knowledge about graphs may crack the code. Overthinking is a sin.

Youâ€™re going to have a great time with this problemâ€¦ or will you? ðŸŒ¸
Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the macro-averaged F1-score.

For each class i, the F1-score is defined as:

where

and ( TP_i ), ( FP_i ), and ( FN_i ) represent the true positives, false positives, and false negatives for class i.

The macro F1-score is then computed as the simple average across all classes:

Each row in the test set corresponds to one flower sample.
Your goal is to predict the correct species label (target) for each ID.

Public leaderboard scores are calculated on 30% of the test data ,
and private leaderboard scores are calculated on the remaining 70%
Submission Format

To submit, upload a CSV file with exactly these two columns:
ID 	target
51 	0
52 	1
53 	2

Requirements:

The ID values must exactly match those provided in the test set.
The target column should contain your predicted class labels (0, 1, or 2).
Do not include any extra columns or headers besides ID and target.

Example Submission

Dataset & Problem Overview
Dataset Files

The dataset provided for this competition contains the following files:

    train.csv
        Contains 50% of the full dataset.
        Includes all features along with the Genre column.
        Participants will use this file to train their models. 

    test.csv
        Contains the remaining 50% of the dataset.
        Participants will use this file to make predictions for the public leaderboard. 

    sample_submission.csv
        A template submission file.
        Shows the required format (ID and predicted Genre comma-separated).
        Can be used to test submission code before uploading.

Dataset Columns

The dataset contains 11 columns (in addition to Genre for train and solution for scoring):
Column Name 	Description
Name 	Name of the K-Drama
Aired Date 	First air date of the show (e.g., May 14, 2021)
Year of release 	Year the show was released
Original Network 	The network or platform that originally aired the show (e.g., Netflix, KBS)
Aired On 	Day(s) of the week when episodes were aired
Number of Episodes 	Total episodes in the series
Duration 	Average duration of each episode (e.g., 52 min)
Content Rating 	Age rating or content restrictions (e.g., 18+ Restricted)
Rating 	Viewer rating (e.g., IMDb or internal rating)
Synopsis 	Short description of the plot/story
Tags 	Key themes or topics (comma-separated)
Director 	Director(s) of the K-Drama
Screenwriter 	Writer(s) of the series
Cast 	Main actors/actresses
Production companies 	Companies that produced the K-Drama
Rank 	Rank based on popularity or rating
Genre 	Target variable: comma-separated genres (only in train.csv and solution.csv)

    Note: Some columns such as Genre are only available in train.csv and solution.csv, and not in test.csv.

Multi-Label Target

    The Genre column is comma-separated, meaning each show may belong to multiple genres (e.g., Drama, Romance, Family).
    Participants must predict all applicable genres for each K-Drama.
    The evaluation metric is Jaccard-based, rewarding partial matches proportionally.

Usage Notes

    train.csv â†’ For training your model.
    test.csv â†’ Make predictions to submit for scoring.
    sample_submission.csv â†’ Template for submission format.

Leaderboard Split:

    Public: 50% of test rows
    Private: 50% of test rows (used for final ranking)

    No pre-trained models or external datasets are allowed.
    Models must be built from scratch using libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, or custom code."
